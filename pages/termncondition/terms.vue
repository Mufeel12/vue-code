                    <p>
                        Here, I focus on a range of items and features that we use in life without
                        giving them a second thought such as Coca Cola, body muscles and holding
                        ones own breath. Though, most of these notes are not fundamentally
                        necessary, they are such that you can use them for a good laugh, at a drinks
                        party or for picking up women or men.
                    </p>
                    <p>1) Coca-Cola: Did you know that its original colour was green?</p>
                    <p>
                        2) Mohammed: Did you know that this is the most used name in the entire
                        world?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3) Geographical Letters: Did you know that the name of each of the
                        continents begins and concludes with the exact same alphabet? Do not believe
                        that? Look up Asia, Europe, Africa, America, Antarctica and the rest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        4) Muscle Strength: Did you know that the strongest muscle in the entire
                        body is that one which we use to lick a popsicle? Your tongue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5) Credit Cards: In the United States, were you aware that each and every
                        person has at least two credit cards?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6) An Antique Machine: The word for an old machine that was once used for
                        writing letters and other documents is the largest word that one can make if
                        they click only on a single row of their computerâ€™s keyboard: typewriter!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7) Blink: Men wink at women, but research has found out that the average
                        woman blinks nearly two times more than the average man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8) Suicide: Even though you might have wondered if it was possible, studies
                        have discovered that it is impossible to kill oneself by simply holding in
                        your breath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9) Licking: However much you may try, you will never be able to lick your
                        elbows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10) Sneeze: Try sneezing. People will automatically answer you with a bless
                        you greeting. Have you ever imagined why? Some say that this happens because
                        a sneeze stops the functioning of the heart for a very tiny second.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        11) The Blue Sky: Did you know that a pig, no matter how much they try,
                        cannot look up into the sky?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        12) Twisting Your Tongue: We have all dabbled with different tongue-twisters
                        in our day. But do you know which is the toughest? Sixth sick sheiks sixth
                        sheeps sick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        13) Ribs: Did you know that you should try not to sneeze too strongly. Why?
                        A very powerful sneeze has the ability to cause a fracture in your ribcage.
                        But, then again, if you try and withhold one, you stand the chance of
                        breaking one of the many blood vessels in your neck or head. This could
                        cause death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        14) Cards: Did you think that the Kings are all just random cards referring
                        to random figures? No. Each one signifies a different king: Diamonds for
                        Julius Caesar, Clubs for Alexander the Great, Spades for David and Hearts
                        for Charlemagne.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        15) And finally: Most everyone reading this (Caught You!) are trying to lick
                        their elbows at this exact moment!
                    </p>
